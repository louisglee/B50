Project B50 stands for Balaji 50. This series of Tweets and blog posts are in response to @dickiebush‚Äôs Tweet below:

Who‚Äôs Balaji? 

Balaji S. Srinivasan is an angel investor and entrepreneur. Formerly the CTO of Coinbase and General Partner at Andreessen Horowitz, he was also the cofounder of Earn.com (acquired by Coinbase), Counsyl (acquired by Myriad), Teleport (acquired by Topia), and Coin Center. (via balajis.com)

@balajis has unique ideas in tech, economics, and government, but these ideas stem from his deep knowledge of history, science, and technology. I use his references as a type of curation system. You‚Äôll often hear Balaji say ‚Äúhave you read . . .‚Äù or ‚Äúhave you heard about . . .‚Äù on his podcast interviews. When I haven‚Äôt heard of the article, Tweet, or book he mentions, I write it down or search it to save for later. His ideas are the tip of the iceberg when it comes to digging deeper into ideas such as crypto-currencies, socialism, and life extension to name a few. 

Taking concepts from an innovative thinker and operator such as Balaji is an opportunity to think through ideas in an attempt to find the music through the static. 

The current landscape is dealing with multiple revolutions on various fronts. From a global health crisis to geopolitical economic instability, and social disruption, finding order in the chaos requires clear thinking, which is a result of clear writing.

I‚Äôll be double-clicking on concepts interesting to me from Balaji‚Äôs writings, interviews, and Tweets, citing relevant cross-references along the way. 

My first version of each essay will start off as Twitter threads tagged #B50. If there are Tweets I see gaining traction, I‚Äôll dive deeper into the topic and post a full-length blog post here. 

If there are gaps in my thinking or other ways to approach the ideas I‚Äôm grappling with, please feel free to comment on each post or send me a Tweet @_Louis_Lee.
